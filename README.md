# pdfmerge
A simple CLI tool for combining multiple PDF files into one PDF file.

## Why?
Homework submissions for my ECE202 class require the inclusion of code, console output, and handwritten calculations for full credit, and the submission portal is configured to allow one file to be uploaded. 

## Usage
`pdfmerge [-h] [-v] file1 file2 ... output.pdf`

## Example
`pdfmerge M1Code.pdf M1Console.pdf M1Handwritten.pdf M1Combined.pdf`
